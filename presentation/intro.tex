\begin{frame}{The Intervention Problem}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A human user (or an agent) is doing something online that may have an undesirable outcome that it can not recognize
		\item Two sub-problems:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Intervention Recognition}: Identify what the user is doing is ``bad''
		\item \textbf{Intervention Recovery}: Help the user decide what to do next
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Use automated planning as a framework to model and understand}:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Human user behavior in cyber-security
		\item Problem solving in the Rush Hour puzzle
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
