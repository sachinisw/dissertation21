\begin{frame} {Designing Intervention for Cyber-security Domain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Home computer users might not think about the post-conditions of actions while performing common tasks
\item Home computer users might not perceive preconditions that exist in the state (e.g., padlock icons/HTTPS)

\item Intervention solution needs to address:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users do not complete tasks methodically (e.g., repeated actions, skips) $\Rightarrow$ \texttt{noise in observations}
\item Intervention must be decided as and when observations become available  $\Rightarrow$ \texttt{online operation}
\item Need to evaluate proximity to an exploit regardless of the user's goal $\Rightarrow$ \texttt{user's desirable goal is unknown}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
