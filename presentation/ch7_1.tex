\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Qualitatively human users prefer the ''\textbf{Show the next best move}'' hint
\item Quantitatively the use of Human-aware Intervention did not statistically significantly change the solution length, the difference to the optimal,  landmark achievement time and landmark regain
\item Use of different help types significantly affect the solution length
\item Need to strike a balance between revealing too much information   (i.e., complete solution) and too little information (i.e., next best move) about the planning problem.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intervention is viewed as two sub processes
\begin{itemize}
\item Intervention Recognition (proposed 3 solutions)
\item Intervention Recovery (proposed 1 solution)
\end{itemize}
\item Solutions combine automated planning and machine learning
\item Evaluated on synthetic domains and realistic data from human subject studies
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Future Work:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explore different models of the actors' environment
\item Domain abstraction techniques to support intervention recovery
\item Ensuring longevity of interactive intervention models
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
