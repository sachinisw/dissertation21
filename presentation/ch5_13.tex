\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced a family of Intervention Problems
\begin{itemize}
\item Intervention for a single actor (planning agent)
\item Intervention for an actor in the presence of a competitor (planning agents)
\item Human-Aware Intervention for a single actor (human user)
\end{itemize}
\item Solutions
\begin{itemize}
\item If the actor is a planning agent - Plan Suffix Analysis
\item If the actor is a human user -  Observed History Analysis
\end{itemize}
\item Proposed learning based intervention outperforms existing plan recognition algorithms
\end{itemize}
