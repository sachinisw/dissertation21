\begin{frame}{Unhelpful Plan Prefix Recognition - Sampling the Plan Space}
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of computing exact distances and probabilities compute an \textbf{estimated proximity to $G_0$ and $G_1$}
\item Use an automated planner to find two sets of solutions for $\langle M, G_0\rangle$ and  $\langle M, G_1\rangle$
\item Compute a \textit{reference plan} $= \lbrace observations + \pi^*\rbrace$, 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pi^*$ - cost optimal plan from the current state to the goal for $G_0$
\end{itemize}
\item Compute the ``distances'' between the \textit{reference plan} and the two solution sets


\begin{itemize}
\item Is the reference plan more similar to sampled $G_0$ plans or $G_1$ plans?
\item Use plan similarity metrics
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
