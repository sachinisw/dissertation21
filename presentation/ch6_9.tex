\begin{frame}{Quantitative Evaluation}
\textbf{Evaluation Metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of moves in the human user's solution
\item The difference from the cost optimal solution
\item The latest time a fact landmark is eventually achieved (landmark achievement)
\item The number of times a fact landmark is lost and regained (landmark regain)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Evaluation Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the Interactive Human-aware Intervention have an effect on the solution length? (Metric 1)
\item Does the Interactive Human-aware Intervention help move the user closer to the optimal solution? (Metric 2, 3, 4)
\item Does seeing a help video affect the solution length? (Metric 1)
\end{enumerate}
