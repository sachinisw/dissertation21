\begin{frame}{Research Question 1: \\Sources of Salient Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use an automated planner
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the different characteristics between solutions \textbf{ obtained from a planner} that contain undesirable moves and solutions that do not?
\item Propose two recognition algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Intervention by unhelpful plan prefix recognition}
\item \textbf{Intervention by critical action recognition}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Use human solvers
\begin{itemize}
\item If the human solver found a solution without making any undesirable move, what did he do differently than someone who made an undesirable move?
\item Propose one recognition algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Intervention by user behavior classification}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
