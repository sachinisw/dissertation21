\begin{frame}{The Gap in Existing Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The goal/plan recognition problem 
\begin{itemize}
\item The intervening agent can infer the goal/plan of the actor using the observations as evidence
\item May not work if the actor's likely goals are too similar
\end{itemize}
\item We use machine learning to learn the differences between safe and unsafe plan suffixes.

\item The Intervention Problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Online
\item Actors may have different views of the domain
\item Intervene on time but allow the actor to pursue his own goal
\item Intervention recovery
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
