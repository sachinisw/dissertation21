\begin{frame}{Experiments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Planning domain from the home computer cyber-security study
		\item Four benchmark planning domains (Blocks words, navigator, ipc-grid+, logistics)

		\item Four undesirable states for each domain
		\item Observation traces of actions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Activity logs (n=61) captured during the human subject study
			\item Synthetic traces generated with controlled levels of noise and missing actions for benchmark domains
		\end{itemize}
		\item Metric weights
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 7 classes of discrete weight assignments for the three metrics
			\item (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (.33,.33,.33), (.5,.5,0), (.5,0,.5), (0,.5,.5)
		\end{itemize}
