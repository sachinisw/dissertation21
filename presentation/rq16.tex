\begin{frame}{Intervention by Unhelpful Plan Prefix Recognition}
Assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item $G_0$ is user's goal $G_1$ the  undesirable goal
\item The observer has full observability
\item Knows about $G_0$ and $G_1$ and helps the user avoid $G_1$. 
\item $G_1$ is unknown to the user. 
\item $G_0$ is unknown to the competitor (if present)
\item User can not recognize effects of competitor's actions. Some of user's own actions may have hidden effects
\item User follows a satisficing plan to reach $G_0$, and may reach $G_1$ unwittingly
\end{itemize}
The observer's problem \\
\textit{\textbf{Given the action history, must the proposed action be flagged to help the user avoid $G_1$}?}
